Wrangle and Generate insights from the WeRateDogs twitter archive.

Data was gathered from three sources: the WeRateDogs twitter archive, programmatically downloaded tweet image predictions file, and by using JSON on a file gotten from the Twitter API. 

Due to non-granted access to Twitter API, a ready made file has been used directly instead.

This project makes use of popular Python Data Analysis and Web Scraping libraries including Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, JSON, etc.
